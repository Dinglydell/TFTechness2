-automated barrels

-iron/steel components as anvil recipes?

-change light engineering blocks to steel, heavy engineering to black steel?

-treated lumber?

Mid-term:

-Railcraft

-Advanced rocketry

-big reactors?

-RF forge (multiblock)

-Automated anvil - either metal press or its own machine(s)

-Allow swappable parts in multiblocks - such as an upgradable casing that determines
 how good of an insulator it is
 
 -Reintroduction of the cryothermic chamber (known to some as a "fridge")
 
 -RF Crucible (could be the same as a forge but with some special parts in the multiblock



Longer term (low priority, distant future):

-infa-red googles - allowing you to see exact temperature of items

-advanced machine multiblocks that have a functionality dependent on the types of components used?
