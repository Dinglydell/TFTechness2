
-iron/steel components as anvil recipes?

-placeable treated lumber?

-allow external heater to be used to keep crops warm during winter?

-make wooden rails rot? (due to lack of creosote)

-bronze minecart that has a chance of breaking down?
  -or only have bronze cargo cart with very limited storage

-maybe get railcraft machines to rest at the external temperature (doesn't look feasible)

-steam powered pump?

-do more with treat barrels - possibly auto seal/unseal

Mid-term:

-Railcraft
    -tunnel bore + support beams?

-Advanced rocketry
    -gate things like force track emitter behind space
    -climate & temperature for other planets (feasible?)
    -space oregen (use TFC ores?)

-big reactors?
    -refinement process for pitchblende

-RF forge (multiblock)

-Automated anvil - either metal press or its own machine(s)

-Allow swappable parts in multiblocks - such as an upgradable casing that determines
 how good of an insulator it is

 -multiblock components with melting/deformation temperatures - eg a silver based wall component may be a great conductor but will melt if you heat it too much

 -Reintroduction of the cryothermic chamber (known to some as a "fridge")
    -cellars addon?

 -RF Crucible (could be the same as a forge but with some special parts in the multiblock



Longer term (low priority/distant future):

-infa-red googles - allowing you to see exact temperature of items

-advanced machine multiblocks that have a functionality dependent on the types of components used?

-go through all the manual things one has to do in vanilla TFC and make sure there's a way of automating it eventually.
    Automation will probably mostly be done through mentioned advanced machine multiblocks
