-treated wood as a barrel recipe

-automated barrels

-iron/steel components as anvil recipes?

-change light engineering blocks to steel, heavy engineering to black steel?


Mid-term:

-Railcraft

-Advanced rocketry

-RF forge (multiblock)

-Allow swappable parts in multiblocks - such as an upgradable casing that determines
 how good of an insulator it is



Longer term (low priority, distant future):

-infa-red googles - allowing you to see exact temperature of items

-advanced machine multiblocks that have a functionality dependent on the types of components used?
