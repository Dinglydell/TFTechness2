-automated barrels

-iron/steel components as anvil recipes?

-treated lumber?

-allow external heater to be used to keep crops warm during winter?

-make wooden rails rot? (due to lack of creosote)

-bronze minecart that has a chance of breaking down?
  -or only have bronze cargo cart with very limited storage

-maybe get railcraft machines to rest at the external temperature

-steam powered pump?

Mid-term:

-Railcraft
    -tunnel bore + support beams?
    
-Advanced rocketry
    -gate things like force track emitter behind space
    -climate & temperature for other planets (feasible?)

-big reactors?
    -refinement process for pitchblende

-RF forge (multiblock)

-Automated anvil - either metal press or its own machine(s)

-Allow swappable parts in multiblocks - such as an upgradable casing that determines
 how good of an insulator it is
 
 -Reintroduction of the cryothermic chamber (known to some as a "fridge")
    -cellars addon?
 
 -RF Crucible (could be the same as a forge but with some special parts in the multiblock



Longer term (low priority/distant future):

-infa-red googles - allowing you to see exact temperature of items

-advanced machine multiblocks that have a functionality dependent on the types of components used?
