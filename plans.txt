
-iron/steel components as anvil recipes?

-placeable treated lumber?

-allow external heater to be used to keep crops warm during winter?
    -related: multiblock machines having a small affect on ambient temperature up to 1 block away from them?
        -this may never happen because the potential performance issues

-make wooden rails rot? (due to lack of creosote)

-bronze minecart that has a chance of breaking down?
  -or only have bronze cargo cart with very limited storage

-maybe get railcraft machines to rest at the external temperature (doesn't look feasible)

-steam powered pump?

-do more with treat barrels - possibly auto seal/unseal

Mid-term:

-Railcraft
    -tunnel bore + support beams?

-Advanced rocketry
    -gate things like force track emitter behind space
    -climate & temperature for other planets (feasible?)
    -space oregen (use TFC ores?)

-big reactors?
    -refinement process for pitchblende

-Automated anvil - either metal press or its own machine(s)

-rewrite tank such that fluids have varying pressure - so they don't have a fixed density to solve issues such as aluminium not being formed because it causes the thing to go over capacity

 -multiblock components with melting/deformation temperatures - eg a silver based wall component may be a great conductor but will melt if you heat it too much
 -multiblock components with an additional material for the "coating" of the block - this will determine the conductivity with the air as opposed to other machine blocks
 -multiblock components that consider the atmospheric conditions of the planet its on when calculating heat loss to the environment
 -steam powered multiblock components?
 -target temperature in multiblocks
 -materials with electrical resistance and/or a limited transfer rate?
 -multiblocks capable of generating RF
 -gasses and pressure in a SolutionTank (with explosions!)
 -related to above, different materials providing different strength - such as having a max pressure difference property
 -dynamic texture for multiblock parts based on material

 -temperature monitor component - can tell you the temperature of neighbour blocks
   -can turn off neighbouring heating/cooling elements based on a target temperature

 -compound registry - every item is registered with what compounds it contains - these compounds are composed of elements
 -reactions in the solution tank would be based on what can be done with existing elements and compounds in the tank (possibly using enthalpy and/or entropy)
 -densities of stuff in solution tank that varies with state
 -use vapour pressures for fluids boiling

 -SolutionTank with alloy mixing!

 -better multiblock component recipes - a multistage process with anvils?



Longer term (low priority/distant future):

-infa-red googles - allowing you to see exact temperature of items

-go through all the manual things one has to do in vanilla TFC and make sure there's a way of automating it eventually.
    Automation will probably mostly be done through mentioned the component-based machine multiblock system
