-automated barrels

-iron/steel components as anvil recipes?

-change light engineering blocks to steel, heavy engineering to black steel?

-treated lumber?

-increase steam trap damage

-allow external heater to be used to keep crops warm during winter?

-wire as rolling machine recipe? (gates IE wires behind steam -> RC steam engine)

-more steam power stuff

-remove creosote requirement for wooden tracks so that it can be available earlier?

-make it harder to obtain electrum so that MV is not available as soon as you unlock power

-maybe get railcraft machines to rest at the external temperature - almost doesn't affect gameplay but would be a nice addition

Mid-term:

-Railcraft
    -tunnel bore + support beams?
    
-Advanced rocketry
    -gate things like force track emitter behind space

-big reactors?
    -refinement process for pitchblende

-RF forge (multiblock)

-Automated anvil - either metal press or its own machine(s)

-Allow swappable parts in multiblocks - such as an upgradable casing that determines
 how good of an insulator it is
 
 -Reintroduction of the cryothermic chamber (known to some as a "fridge")
 
 -RF Crucible (could be the same as a forge but with some special parts in the multiblock



Longer term (low priority/distant future):

-infa-red googles - allowing you to see exact temperature of items

-advanced machine multiblocks that have a functionality dependent on the types of components used?
